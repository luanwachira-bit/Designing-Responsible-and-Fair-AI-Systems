        "    comparing outcomes for African-American and Caucasian defendants.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **Methodology:** Using Python and Pandas, we replicated key aspects of\n",
        "    ProPublica's analysis. We focused on two critical fairness metrics:\n",
        "    1.  **False Positive Rate (FPR):** The percentage of defendants who *did not*\n",
        "        recidivate within two years but were incorrectly labeled as 'Medium' or\n",
        "        'High' risk by the COMPAS tool.\n",
        "    2.  **False Negative Rate (FNR):** The percentage of defendants who *did*\n",
        "        recidivate within two years but were incorrectly labeled as 'Low' risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **Key Findings:**\n",
        "    Our analysis confirms a significant racial disparity in the COMPAS risk scores,\n",
        "    consistent with ProPublica's findings.\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.  **False Positives:** African-American defendants were far more likely to be\n",
        "        incorrectly labeled as high-risk. We found a False Positive Rate of 42.4%\n",
        "        for African-Americans, compared to just 22.1% for Caucasians. This means\n",
        "        non-recidivating African-Americans were almost twice as likely to be\n",
        "        mislabeled as a future risk.\n",
        "    2.  **False Negatives:** Conversely, Caucasian defendants who *did* recidivate\n",
        "        were more likely to be incorrectly labeled 'Low' risk. We found a False\n",
        "        Negative Rate of 47.1% for Caucasians, compared to 28.4% for\n",
        "        African-Americans. This shows the model was systematically \"under-flagging\"\n",
        "        recidivism risk for Caucasian defendants.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **Conclusion and Remediation:**\n",

        "    parity\" (FPR equality).\n",
        "\n",
        "    **Remediation Steps:**\n",
        "    1.  **Stop Use:** The tool should not be used for sentencing or pre-trial\n",
        "        detention, as its biased outputs can lead to discriminatory outcomes.\n",
        "    2.  **Re-evaluate Features:** Analyze and remove input features that may be\n",
        "        proxies for race (e.g., zip code, certain prior offenses).\n",
        "    3.  **Apply Mitigation:** If a similar tool is to be built, use in-processing\n",
        "        (e.g., adding fairness constraints) or post-processing (e.g.,\n",
